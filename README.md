# StudyFolder

One of my first functional programs which i could use myself. First created in january 2017, heavily updated 18/02-2018.

## What is it about?

The program is a very simple folder management program. It is designed for school usage

You get to choose the following:

- Where do you want the folder to be made
- Which semester do you need
- Which courses do you have on that semester

The program will then create the folders you requested with 7 subfolders.

- Misc.
- Good links
- Homework
- Literature
- Materials
- Assignments
- Tips

An easy way to create the needed folder structure for your semester. Created in C# with WPF.
